# ajQueue-MP

ajQueue-MP supports MultiPaper environment. It fixes the isuue that the plugin only sends player to the first multipaper server. 

CAUTION: There may be errors. It is designed to work only under certain circumstances.

ajQueue is (as far as I can tell) the best queue plugin out there.
It was made because I wasn't satisfied with the existing queue plugins,
all of them either being massively overpriced, or lacking basic features

# Contributing
As long as you don't break anything,
i'll probably accept any merge requests you submit.
I like to have the least number of steps possible for server owners
updating my plugin.

If you need *any* help making your changes, feel free to contact me
on discord. The invite link is on the plugin page ;)
